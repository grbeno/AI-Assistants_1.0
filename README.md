## About

- **AI-Assistants Web Application** includes two LLM-based applications using the OpenAI API.
- (1.) Language Assistant Tool, which translates and corrects texts in and from English, German and Hungarian.
- (2.) Asynchronous Real-Time Chat implemented with Django Channels and WebSocket. 

## Purpose

- I created this application as a user interface to use LLM-based tools online.
- It would be a kind of playground for trying use cases in several fields of expertise (natural language learning, education, data analysis etc.).
- The application is a basic API consumer, using the web as an interface for now.
- The main goal is that the application can handle API communication between the user interface and self-hosted and fine-tuned LLMs.

## Stack

- Backend: Django, Django-RestFramework, Django-Channels, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Frontend: ReactJS, CSS, Bootstrap
- Deployment: Docker, Railway.com

## Development

- Trying and testing other APIs and models from another providers.
- Trying use cases from another fields of experties.
- Appying custom fine-tuned, self-hosted LLMs.
- Prompt engineering.
- Upgrading and trying new web designs.
